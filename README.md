Instructions
------------
As with other MS-DOS applications, now you need to run it inside [DOSBox]. 

You probably need to slow down the CPU. Tweak with **CTRL-11** and **CTRL-12** until it is playable.

  - **LEFT / RIGHT SHIFT** - move player ship
  - **LEFT ALT** - fire rocket

If you have sound on, you will be blasted by roar of the player rocket launch. Even brief explosion if you get killed!

Nerd stuff
----------

Game uses undocumented "wait retrace" in one of the [BIOS functions][ax1003] for accurate timing (as much as possible) and to prevent screen tearing.
